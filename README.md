Bank
====

Introduction
------------

Bank is a card game for 1-4 players. Though the single player version is less of an exciting game, Bank was devised to be very skillful and customisable. 

Bank is one of the most customisable card games due to its large variation of rules allowing players to play as simple or as complex games as they like. Common rule decisions will be made on banking, thieving and scoring.

The ultimate aim of Bank is to be the person with the highest scoring banked cards at the end of the game. A players turn will normally consists of three basic stages; withdrawals, banking, discarding.

Game Start
----------
The game starts by dealing 7 cards to each player. The rest of the deck is placed face down and is called the withdrawal deck. The top card is turned over to start the discard pile. There are several variations to the game start, but these are more rare. A player can never have more than 10 cards in their hand at any time in the game.

**Withdrawal Deck**
* **Standard** - Shared withdrawal deck
* **Personal** - After the initial deal, the deck is split between the remaining players.

**Discard Pile**
* **Standard** - Shared discard pile
* **Personal** - Each player has a personal discard pile.

Withdrawals
-----------
During the withdrawal stage a player picks up a card from the withdrawal deck, placed face down on the table, or from the discard deck, placed face up on the table. The amount of cards a player may withdraw is determined by the ruleset the players have decided to use. The two types of withdrawals are as follows.

* **Standard** - A player may either draw 1 card from the discard pile OR 1 card from the withdrawal deck, OR 2 cards from the withdrawals deck.
* **Balanced Banking** - The rules for balanced banking withdrawals are exactly the same as for standard withdrawals, except they allow the withdrawer to bank twice in a turn if they pick up only one card from the withdrawal deck, and only once for both other withdrawals.

At first it may seem pointless to be able to draw either one or two cards from the withdrawal deck, but all will become clear in the strategy section. A player may have a maximum of ten cards in their hand at any one time. For example if a player has nine cards at the start of a round, they may only pickup a single card from the withdrawal deck. Also as the game nears the end, picking up only one card may be strategically important.

Banking
-------
Banking cards can only take place when a player gets a minimum of a pair of any card value. Variations in the rules denote the usage of pairs, trios and quads.
* **Pairs** - On obtaining a pair, a player may bank one of the cards from the pair, their choice. The other remains in their hand.
* **Trios** - On obtaining a trio (three of a kind), a player must bank one of the trio cards, plus any other card in their hand, this can be another of the trio cards. Remaining cards from the trick, stay in the players hand.
* **Quads** - On obtaining a quad (four of a kind), a player must bank two of the quad cards, plus any two cards from their hand, these can be from the quad. Remaining cards from the trick, stay in the players hand.

Players may choose to bank their entire trick, though it is quite legal to hold a pair from a trio or a quad, and use it next turn. The number of allowed banks per turn depends on the withdrawal rule being played. Banked cards must remain face up and easily visible to other players, unless playing the private banking variation, where the bank is kept face down. Each player banks to their own “bank”, an area to their right or left. A player does not have to bank at all, even if they have a trick in their hand.

**Variations for banking**
* **Standard** - A players bank size has no limit, players can add to their bank until the game ends.
* **Moneybox** - Players have a fixed bank size, in a two player game this would usually be 10. If the limit is reached, players wishing to bank must swap out a card from the bank into their hand.
* **Sievebox** - In this variation, there is an upper limit much like the Moneybox rule, however, the swapped out card must be discarded.

Discarding
----------
Players must discard one card at the end of each turn, placing it face up onto the discard pile.

Game End
--------
There are several variations for the end of the game of Bank.

* **Standard** - The game ends as soon as the last card is taken from the withdrawal deck. A player may finish their turn if they were the last person to draw from the withdrawal deck.
* **Last Chance** - A variation of the standard game end where play continues, even after the withdrawal deck is depleted, players must still discard one card per round and once the withdrawal deck is depleted must only pick up if it results in them being able to make a banking move, unless they still hold a banking move in their hand. If no one picks up or banks for an entire round, the game ends.
* **Five-O** (Can be added to any game end variation) - Players will play until someone's bank score reaches a predetermined limit, usually 50.
* **Rotating Discard** - Once the withdrawal deck is depleted, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the withdrawal deck, play continues until no player can bank anymore. Each time a player can no longer bank they must audibly declare it.

Thieves
-------
Thieves is an optional extra to Bank. There are two types of thief maneuver and these are played at any time during a players turn, meaning if a player thiefs before they withdraw, they can claim a card they will discard back from the discard pile;
* **Thieves** - When a player gets a straight of more than two cards, up to a maximum of five, they can steal a number of cards from any single opponent they choose.
* **Wild Thieves** - Wild thieves are identical to normal thieves except that the straight must be a single colour, either red or black and that the stolen cards come from the opponents bank.

With the following exceptions.
* Their hand may not exceed ten cards.
* The number of cards they can steal is always two less than the size of their straight, eg 4,5,6,7 has a size of 4 enabling 2 cards to be stolen.
* Cards stolen from a hand are done so at random.
* Cards stolen from a bank are seen and chosen, unless playing the private banking variation.
* All cards in the straight must be discarded, players choice for top card.
* Stolen cards goto players hand.

Scoring
-------
The scoring in Bank consists of totalling up a players bank at the end of the game. Two variations are available;
* **Standard** - Each card is worth it’s face value with J, Q, K and A all being worth 10 points each.
* **Advanced** - Scoring works the same as in standard, but banking a pair increases their values by two points, a trio by four points, and a quad by ten. For example K,K,K,2,Q would score 42 for the kings, plus 2, plus 10, equalling 54.
* **The 4 King Banker** - (Can be added to any of the scoring variations) Any player that banks all 4 kings, wins outright, despite their score.

Strategy
--------
As there are so many rule variations to Bank, it is almost impossible to write down a single strategy for winning, other than saying you should bank as many high cards as you can. This being said, there do seem to be some general trends.

In a standard game, high cards are really of most importance. Keeping high cards in your hand is beneficial, even if you don’t have a trick to use. You could for example have a K and an A in your hand, with no corresponding pair left in the deck, however, getting a trio or a quad of another value would enable banking of at least one of these cards. Also, it is obviously advantageous to keep these high cards out of the hands of your opponents. Playing a game without trios or quads would mean that these cards are practically useless to you, but could be even more important to your opponent.

Try to keep a close eye on the discard pile, as well as the banks of other players, they are public for a reason. This should help you determine whether it is worth holding out for a trio or a quad of a certain value of card.

Low cards, generally lower than seven are seldom banked, but will often be held onto to create tricks of trios and quads. When playing thieves, lower cards have much more importance, as using a thief trick with high cards will mean you must discard those cards.

It is also interesting to keep an eye on the number of cards left in the withdrawal deck. Doing so can mean you can be certain of getting that all important last bank before the deck runs out. For example if there are four cards left in a two player game, withdrawing only one card from the withdrawal deck, or even withdrawing from the discard pile will ensure you get a last go. If playing the balanced banking variation, withdrawing one card from the withdrawal deck would mean you could bank twice that round.

If a player decided to withdraw just once every round for an entire game of two player Bank, they could potentially gain themselves and their opponent 3 extra rounds.

There is always a debate about whether it’s better to bank early and often, or if you should hold out for higher value tricks. There is no right/wrong answer, you’ll just have to see what each hand brings. However, playing a variation like the common 5-0 seems to be best won by banking early.

So far the highest solo standard game yielded a score of 216.
