Bank Simple Rules
=================

Bank Introduction
-----------------
Bank is a card game for 1-4 players. Though the single player version is less of an exciting game, Bank was devised to be very skillful and customisable. The card game Bank was created by Peter and Lisa Savage whilst on holiday in Tenerife in 2007. It was originally called Bank, but was later re-named to Bank.

Bank is one of the most customisable card games due to it’s large variation of rules allowing players to play as simple or as complex games as they like. Common rule decisions will be made on banking, theives and scoring.

The ultimate aim of Bank is to be the person with the highest scoring banked cards at the end of the game. A players turn will normally consists of three basic stages; withdrawals, banking, discarding. What appears below is the most common set of rules, eg, the Standard version.

Game Start
----------

The game starts by dealing seven cards to each player. The rest of the deck is placed face down and is called the withdrawal deck. The top card is turned over to start the discard pile.

Withdrawals
-----------

During the withdrawal stage a player picks up a card from the withdrawal deck (placed face down on the table), or from the discard deck, placed (face up on the table). A player may either draw one card from the discard pile OR one card from the withdrawal deck, OR two cards from the withdrawals deck.

At first it may seem pointless to be able to draw either one or two cards from the withdrawal deck, but all will become clear in the strategy section. A player may have a maximum of ten cards in their hand at any one time. For example if a player has nine cards at the start of a round, they may only pickup a single card from the withdrawal deck.

Banking
-------

Banking cards can only take place when a player gets a minimum of a pair of any card value.

* **Pairs** - On obtaining a pair, a player may bank one of the cards from the pair, their choice. The other must remain in their hand.
* **Trios** - On obtaining a trio (three of a kind), a player must bank one of the trio cards, plus any other card in their hand, this can be another of the trio cards if desired. Remaining cards from the trio, stay in the players hand.
* **Quads** - On obtaining a quad (four of a kind), a player must bank two of the quad cards, plus any two cards from their hand, these can be from the quad if desired. Remaining cards from the trick, stay in the players hand.

Players may choose to bank their entire trick, though it is quite legal to hold a pair from a trio or a quad, and use it next turn. The number of allowed banks per turn is one. Banked cards must remain face up and easily visible to other players. Each player banks to their own “bank”, an area to their right or left. A player does not have to bank at all, even if they have a trick in their hand.

Discarding
----------

Players must discard one card at the end of each turn, placing it face up onto the discard pile.

Game End
--------

The game ends as soon as the last card is taken from the withdrawal deck. A player may finish their turn if they were the last person to draw from the withdrawal deck.

Scoring
-------

The scoring in Bank consists of totaling up a players bank at the end of the game. Each card is worth it’s face value with J, Q, K and A all being worth 10 points each.
